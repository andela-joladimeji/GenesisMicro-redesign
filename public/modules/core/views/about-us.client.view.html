                        Here's what I love about recruiting: Every day brings new challenges, but also triumphs. Though my training is in theatre – I’m a recipient of the Kennedy Center’s American College Theatre Festival Award for Excellence in Sound Design…whew, that’s a mouthful! – these days it’s the word ‘hired’ that’s music to my ears.
